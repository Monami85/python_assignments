Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis <br /> <br />
Overview <br />
This repository contains the Python project for the Achievement 4 Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis. The project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Instacart's online grocery store data to uncover sales patterns, derive insights and suggest targeted marketing strategies for better segmentation. 
The analysis aims to answer key business questions posed by stakeholders and inform their decision-making processes.
